# CF_A4_Instacart_Python_Analysis
For my fourth achievement in CareerFoundry’s data analysis course, I’ve been tasked to analyze Instacart’s sales patterns, and answer any business questions, using Python. 
## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. They already have good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insight and suggest strategies for better segmentation.
